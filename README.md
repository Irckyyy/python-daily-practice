# Python Daily Practice

This repository documents my daily Python coding practice, focused on
building consistency, strengthening core Python skills, and becoming
comfortable using Git and GitHub through regular, real-world usage.

The purpose of this repository is not to showcase complex projects, but
to build a sustainable coding habit and reinforce fundamentals through
small, intentional exercises completed consistently over time.

---

## Why this repository exists

This repository was created to support three primary goals:

1. **Build a consistent GitHub contribution streak**  
   Practice coding regularly and develop the habit of shipping code
   daily, even when tasks are small.

2. **Learn Git through hands-on usage**  
   Use Git naturally as part of a daily workflow—committing, pushing,
   and managing changes—rather than relying solely on tutorials.

3. **Use Python beyond data analytics**  
   Explore general-purpose Python through scripting, automation-style
   logic, string processing, file handling, and small CLI programs.

## Repository Structure

- `daily_challenges`: short daily exercises (10–20 minutes)  
- `mini_tools`: refined utilities extracted from challenges  
- `reflections`: weekly notes on progress and learnings

---

## Scope of the challenges

The challenges intentionally start simple and gradually become more
practical. Covered topics include:

- Core Python syntax and control flow
- String and list manipulation
- File reading and writing
- Small command-line utilities
- Simple automation-style logic

This repository is meant to reflect **progress and consistency**, not
polished production systems.

## Daily Challenge Outline

The repository follows a loose daily challenge roadmap to guide
consistent practice. Each challenge is intentionally small and designed
to be completed within 10–20 minutes.

### Days 1–7: Core Python & Logic
- **Day 1:** Greeting generator (input, conditionals, string formatting)
- **Day 2:** Even / odd number checker
- **Day 3:** Simple calculator (basic operations)
- **Day 4:** List statistics (min, max, sum, average)
- **Day 5:** FizzBuzz (control flow)
- **Day 6:** Word counter
- **Day 7:** Username cleaner / formatter

### Days 8–14: Small Programs & File Handling
- **Day 8:** Random password generator
- **Day 9:** Number guessing game
- **Day 10:** Rock–paper–scissors (CLI version)
- **Day 11:** Simple in-memory to-do list
- **Day 12:** File-backed to-do list
- **Day 13:** File extension classifier (e.g. documents, images, code)
- **Day 14:** Log writer with timestamps

### Days 15–21: Data & Text Processing
- **Day 15:** CSV read/write basics
- **Day 16:** Simple data summary from CSV
- **Day 17:** Dice roll simulator and frequency counts
- **Day 18:** Character frequency counter
- **Day 19:** Palindrome checker
- **Day 20:** Anagram checker
- **Day 21:** Mini quiz game with scoring

### Days 22–30: Utilities & Mini Tools
- **Day 22:** JSON save/load operations
- **Day 23:** Simple contact book
- **Day 24:** Text cleaner using basic regex
- **Day 25:** File rename preview tool (safe, no actual renaming)
- **Day 26:** Folder organization planning script
- **Day 27:** Duplicate finder
- **Day 28:** CLI progress bar simulation
- **Day 29:** Text summarizer (word counts, common terms)
- **Day 30:** Menu-based CLI combining selected tools

## Notes

- Commits are made frequently to reflect real daily practice
- Early challenges are intentionally simple by design
- The repository prioritizes clarity and habit-building over difficulty
- More applied or project-based work is maintained in separate repositories

Selected challenges may later be refined and promoted into reusable
scripts under the `mini_tools/` directory.
